For example, you can try this link[^3^] that was shared by a user on Reddit, which leads to an archive of a website that has PDF files of the Kumon Maths Level K solution book and other levels.
- Contact your instructor or center. If you are enrolled in a Kumon center, you can ask your instructor or center staff if they have a copy of the solution book that you can borrow or buy. They might be able to provide you with one or direct you to a reliable source. However, keep in mind that some centers might have policies that prohibit or limit the use of solution books by students.

However, remember that the solution book is not a substitute for learning and practicing the concepts and skills taught in the workbook. You should use it as a reference and a guide, not as a shortcut or a cheat sheet. The best way to improve your math skills is to work on the problems yourself and check your answers with the solution book afterwards.
