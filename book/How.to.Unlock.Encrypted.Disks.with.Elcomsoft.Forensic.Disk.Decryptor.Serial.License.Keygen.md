However, using a serial license keygen is illegal and risky. It may violate the software's terms of service and expose you to legal consequences. It may also contain malware or viruses that can harm your computer or compromise your data. Therefore, we do not recommend using a serial license keygen to unlock encrypted disks with Elcomsoft Forensic Disk Decryptor.

How does Elcomsoft Forensic Disk Decryptor work? Elcomsoft Forensic Disk Decryptor works by extracting the encryption keys from the computer's memory or disk. The encryption keys are used to encrypt and decrypt the data stored in the encrypted disks or containers. Without the encryption keys, the data is inaccessible and unreadable.
 
Elcomsoft Forensic Disk Decryptor can extract the encryption keys from different sources, depending on the type of encryption and the availability of the computer. The sources include:
 
- RAM captures: Elcomsoft Forensic Disk Decryptor can capture the content of the computer's volatile memory with a kernel-level tool. The memory dump may contain the encryption keys for BitLocker, FileVault 2, PGP, TrueCrypt and VeraCrypt disks and containers.
- Hibernation and page files: Elcomsoft Forensic Disk Decryptor can analyze the hibernation and page files that are created when the computer enters sleep or hibernation mode. The hibernation and page files may contain the encryption keys for BitLocker, FileVault 2, PGP, TrueCrypt and VeraCrypt disks and containers.
- Plain-text password or escrow keys: Elcomsoft Forensic Disk Decryptor can use the plain-text password or escrow keys to decrypt files and folders stored in crypto containers or mount encrypted volumes as new drive letters. The plain-text password is the user's password that is used to unlock the encrypted disk or container. The escrow key is a backup key that is stored in a secure location, such as iCloud for FileVault 2 or Active Directory for BitLocker.
- Encryption metadata: Elcomsoft Forensic Disk Decryptor can extract encryption metadata from TrueCrypt, VeraCrypt, BitLocker, FileVault 2, PGP Disk, LUKS/LUKS2 encrypted disks and Jetico BestCrypt disks and containers. The encryption metadata contains information about the encryption algorithm and parameters that are used to generate the encryption key from the password. Elcomsoft Forensic Disk Decryptor can use this information to perform a brute-force attack on the password with Elcomsoft Distributed Password Recovery.

Once Elcomsoft Forensic Disk Decryptor obtains the encryption keys from any of these sources, it can decrypt the data stored in encrypted disks or containers or mount them as new drive letters for instant access.
