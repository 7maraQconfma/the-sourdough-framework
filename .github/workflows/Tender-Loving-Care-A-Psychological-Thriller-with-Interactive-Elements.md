Tender Loving Care stars the acclaimed British actor, and 2-time Oscar nominee, John Hurt (Contact, Love and Death on Long Island, Elephant Man) as Dr. Turner, a psychiatrist who guides you through the story. TLC is a feature-length film seamlessly combined with computer-game like navigation and interactivity. You are voyeur, detective, judge, and patient all in one. Between each variable scene, Dr. Turner enlists your help in assessing the behaviour of each of the films characters - Turner's beautiful, deluded patient, her dangerous husband, and the mysterious, seductive psychiatric nurse enlisted to provide what may, or may not be, TENDER LOVING CARE. Your answers to Dr. Turner questions shape the course of the action and the final outcome of the story. You also become one of Dr. Turner's patients, taking a series of Thematic Apperception Tests (TATs), the results of which create a progressively accumulating personal psychological profile.
